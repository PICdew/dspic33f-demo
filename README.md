This project requires three things:

1. MPLAB X IDE from Microchip, based on NetBeans
2. A dsPIC33FJ256GP710A microprocessor.
3. An Explorer 16 development board with LED, LCD, and
   push button peripherals.

This project is a demonstration of how to use the dsPIC33f and
Explorer 16 board. It enables primitive usage of the LCD, LED, and push button
peripherals. Interrupts enqueue events to be processed in the main event loop.
No dynamic allocation is performed.
